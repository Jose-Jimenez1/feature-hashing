In the context of the project, the need arises for a methodology that allows taking advantage of the characteristics shared between different tasks to improve the performance of the model. This is where the concept of “Feature Hashing” comes into play. This technique seeks to reduce dimensionality and optimize feature representation, thus facilitating large-scale hashing. Recoding of the voxelized representation of a crystallographic structure of solid-state materials will be performed, subject to geometric properties of the material not being lost.
